# 100 Days of Swift

Swift learn basic challenge from [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100)

## Rules
Do the following **every day** for **100 days**:
* Spend **one hour**<sup>*</sup> reading/watching Swift tutorials, or writing Swift code.
* Update progress in repo **documentation**.

<sup>*</sup>Limiting time spent is meant to avoid burnt-out, dicipline and consistency is preffered for long term gain.
